      <h2>üòº About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science major at Easwari Engineering College, currently in my fourth year. I find everything
        about computers exciting and always want to learn more about how they work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy playing and watching tactically oriented games. Football is a personal favorite of mine. I also love
        professional chess and esports like CS2, Dota 2 and Deadlock.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy stories with lore-oriented narratives. My favorite genres are fantasy and sci-fi. I seek out media with
        a lot of artistic expression and find myself appreciating stories more when people can have different
        experiences with them.

      <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Billing software:<br>
        A react.js based billing user interface with a fast backend written using Golang's Fiber framework and a
        scalable PostgreSQL database. It follows a RESTful API approach and uses security-oriented programming
        practices. Json Web Tokens(JWT) are used for stateless user authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Java E-Commerce Website:<br>
        A robust e-Commerce website designed using the MVC architecture with Java servlets, JSP pages, DAO and a MySQL
        database. It uses session-based authentication to authorize product ordering and cancellation.
      </p>

      <p>
        OCR Model:<br>
        An OCR deep neural network was trained using PyTorch and the IAM_Words dataset, it is capable of reading
        handwritten text as images and providing the exact words present in the image with satisfactory accuracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Android Calculator App:<br>
        An android application capable of operating as a simple calculator was developed using the Android Studio IDE.
        Java for the controller and Xml for the view were used in the development process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Web Scraper:<br>
        A web scraper that would honour the robots.txt, rotate between tor circuits, set up traffic routing proxies, use
        a selenium web driver and create a random user agent before the scraping process in order to ensure unsuspicious
        web scraping of websites like Amazon.com and Aaj Tak news.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flappy Bird Clone:<br>
        A fully functional clone of the classic mobile game 'Flappy Bird' was created using the Java framework known as
        'Processing'.
      </p>

      <p>
        React Todo List:<br>
        A react.js based simple Todo List app with a beautiful font style, session based storage and a minimal layout
        for users to focus on the tasks ahead during the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Message classifier Bot:<br>
        Reads messages from WhatsApp chats, splits them to comply with Hugging Face API limitations, and uses Zero-Shot
        Classification to categorize the messages under multiple classes. The messages are classified and uploaded to
        the specified Discord channel.
      </p>

      <p>
        API Transliteration:<br>
        Transliterates input text into a supported language by choosing the best result from various free API's. A clean
        streamlit user interface provides users with a minimal and understandable transliteration page.
      </p>

      <p>
        MS Word Text Translator:<br>
        A Python program was created to read the contents of a Word file and translate the text into any language
        supported by the 'translatepy' library.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gender Classification Model:<br>
        A classification model that determines the gender of a person based on various speech related acoustic
        parameters was developed
        using a preprocessed dataset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Movie Recommender System:<br>
        A machine learning recommendation system was created to list the five most similar movies to the movie given as
        input by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        CPU simulator[Ongoing]:<br>
        Currently developing and designing a top-down, simulator for the legendary Intel 8008 microprocessor with a
        working ALU, Instruction Encoder/Decoder and CPU Registries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Top Down Space Shooter[Ongoing]:<br>
        Currently developing and designing a top-down, space-themed shooter game with unique mechanics and a deep skill
        progression system.
